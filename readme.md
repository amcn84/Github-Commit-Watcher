# Github Commit Watcher

Github Commit Watcher is a GitHub API Commit watcher that monitors API commits for specic events such as Quackcon. This could be adapted for anything you need to monitor commits for.


### Displays

Github Commit Watcher uses the GitHub API to:

* Fetch the number of commits for specific users and repositories
* Information is displayed in a nifty chart powered by amcharts.com

### Installation

Github Commit Watcher can be placed as is into your web server as long as the PHP curl module is available.
- Add your basic authentication key to the update.php file
- Add your token from PostMan (My case may not be the same for your case)
